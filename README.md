This is a "simple" IM client and server.

Currently it asks for an instance server, but doesn't require it to start.

Dependencies, Rust, GTK, gdk, gio, a working C compiler.
`cargo build`

Then
`cargo run`

The window will appear, prompting for instance information.

Clicking "Jack In" will open the messaging dialogue.

Plans for this are on hold until later.
